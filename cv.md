## ADDITIONAL
#### I have a wife and 1.5 years old daughter and realize that my income of 450 usd doesn't let me provide family with all necessary things. So I spoke with my friend (he works about 15 years in IT) and he proposed help. Now i've been studying react and typescript for 3 month and developed some simple pet-projects. I will be glad to have an opportunity to participate in commercial IT-development.
